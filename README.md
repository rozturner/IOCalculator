# IOCalculator
Very small Python script which calculates IO based on EP profit and QL. Here's how it works:

Implied Odds = (Extra Place profit / Qualifying Loss) + 1
Enter the QL as a positive integer to ensure correct results.
Improvements, feedback etc hugely welcome - this is my first Python project :)

Peace out!
